# What's New in v2.0.0

Version 2.0.0 is a massive architectural overhaul of the jQuery Event Calendar plugin. While the external API and DOM outputs remain strictly 100% isofunctional with previous versions to ensure backward compatibility, the internal engine has been completely rebuilt.

### 🚀 Major Highlights
* **TypeScript Migration**: The entire source code is now strongly typed (TypeScript 5+), preventing runtime errors and providing full IntelliSense support.
* **Object-Oriented Architecture**: Eradicated the old global variables and massive jQuery `each` loops. The plugin now uses a highly encapsulated `EventCalendarInstance` class. State is now managed internally rather than relying on DOM attributes (e.g., `data-current-year`).
* **Modern ECMAScript**: Replaced legacy jQuery utilities (`$.each`, `$.grep`) with modern, highly optimized array methods (`forEach`, `filter`). String building now uses Template Literals instead of clunky regex replaces.
* **Testability**: The decoupling of the logic from direct DOM manipulation allows for rapid and reliable testing using `Jest` and `JSDOM`.

### 🔧 Developer Experience
* Added `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` for a standardized build process.
* Added an automated testing suite setup. Run `npm run test` to verify functionality.
